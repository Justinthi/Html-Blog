                    <h2>Edmonton at a Glance</h2>
                        <p>
                            Edmonton is a vibrant city that combines natural scenery with urban
                            attractions, making it a great destination for short trips or weekend travel. The
                            river valley offers extensive trails and viewpoints that feel surprisingly close to 
                            downtown. The city also has lively neighbourhoods with local restaurants, cafés, and
                            shops that are easy to explore on foot.
                        </p>

                            <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                            <p>
                                The best time to visit Edmonton depends on your interests: Visit in the Summer (June-August) for the festivals and outdoor activities.
                                Fall (September-October) provides beautiful foliage with fewer crowds and lower costs. Winter (December-February) is ideal for snow sports and unique events like Ice on Whyte but is very cold.
                                Finally Spring (March-May) brings blooming flowers and mild weather, great for a quieter trip before the summer rush.
